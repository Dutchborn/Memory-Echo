# Memory Echo

Memory Echo is an ambient, interactive web app that lets users record short memories as color-coded "echoes" that float on-screen. Each memory includes:

- A short reflective note (like a moment or mood)
- A color that represents the emotion or vibe
- A sound file (ambient, music, voice)

These memories are visualized as floating orbs. Clicking an orb:
- Plays the sound
- Briefly displays the text
- Creates a calming, emotional moment

## 🎯 Why It Exists

- Helps users **reflect and decompress**
- Encourages **emotional mindfulness** through sound + color
- Can be used as a **daily journal**, **mood tracker**, or just a **creative memory space**
- Visually and sonically engaging for accessibility and self-expression

## 💡 Real-Life Use Cases

This app isn't just about storing notes — it's about emotion, memory, and sensory connection. Here’s how different people might use it:

| Who Might Use It? | How It Helps |
|-------------------|--------------|
| A stressed-out student | Stores moments that made them feel calm, along with soothing sounds |
| A creative person | Logs small inspirations: a thought, a sound, a color — like a digital sketchbook |
| Someone healing from grief | Keeps safe memories they don’t want to forget, in a gentle, sensory way |
| Neurodivergent users | Connects sensory input (sound, color) with emotion — a tool for grounding and regulation |
| Anyone tired of text-only journaling | Gives a visual + audio layer to memory, not just text |

## 🔍 Why It's Different

Memory Echo isn’t a typical journal or tracker. It’s designed to feel artistic, ambient, and meditative.

- You don’t write pages — you record a **single feeling**.
- You don’t browse folders — you explore **colorful orbs**.
- You don’t just read — you **hear, see, and reflect**.
- There’s no timeline or list — just **floating echoes of emotion**.

This makes it perfect for people who want a calmer, more sensory way to process memories and emotions — without pressure, perfection, or noise.
